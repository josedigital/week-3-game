1. word is chosen at random from word bank
  word = wordbank[randomNum]
  wordArray = word.split('') <-- turn word into array
2. user gets number of guesses based on number of letters in word
  numGuesses = word.length
3. user types letters to start guessing
  . check if userGuess is in wordArray. if letter is found in word:
    1. find index of letter in wordArray (if yes, add userGuess to blankWord at index i)
    2. push to spaces at proper index
    . if all letters are guessed correctly, player wins
  . else 
    . add letter to wrongGuesses
    . subtract 1 from numGuesses
    . if numGuesses === 0 player loses
